## NFTs Choice 

NFTs: a unique digital asset with on-chain representation of ownership and identification of its authenticity that include assets where the value is embedded in the data of the NFT, external to the NFT (in-game items), or with an off chain asset (real estate or IP rights). We believe in the valuable characteristics of NFTs that include:

## NFTs create provable and inherently authenticated digital ownership
NFTs are an on-chain representation of the ownership of value. The value itself can be represented in the NFT (e.g. embedded data), external to the NFT like digital-native items (e.g. in game items), or off chain entirely (e.g. real estate or IP rights).  Easy analogies to the traditional world are the title to your house or a ticket to a concert.  The title is not the actual house, but the record of ownership for the house and the ticket is not the actual seat at the concert, but rather the record of ownership for that seat at that particular concert.  An NFT, or on-chain ownership record, is represented by a token therefore takes on highly valuable characteristics such as 

Programmability.
For example, the NFT could programmatically not be allowed to be transferred without satisfying a royalty payment
Divisibility. 

For example, NFT ownership can easily be fractionalized to increase addressable market or to raise additional funds
Transferability. 

For example, an NFT can be transferred from account to account without onerous paperwork requirements.

Provability. For example, the provenance of any NFT can be immediately known simply by querying the blockchain for its ownership history

Authenticity. 
For example, there can be no fraud or duplication of the ownership record as it is cryptographically unique and secure
