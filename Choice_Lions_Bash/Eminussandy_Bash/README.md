# CHOICE COIN NFT
This project is designed to allow users with no coding knowledge to buy NFT with a web interface which interacts with their algosigner extension. 

The only requirement needed is a cloudinary account with your api key, which you must put in a .env file. You can look at the .env_sample to create your own .env file or rename .env_sample to .env. The cloudinary account is needed to host your image to give users access to view your NFT.


## INSTALLATION 
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
$ python3 run.py
```
