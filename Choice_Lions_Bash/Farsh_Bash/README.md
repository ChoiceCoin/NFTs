# FARSH_NFT_BASH SUBMISSION

Non-Fungible tokens are a configurable subset of Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) to represent regular or decentralized digital assets.

NFTs are created using Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs), which are built into the protocol and created using a special type of transaction. This is distinct from some other blockchains where a smart contract is necessary to represent assets.
