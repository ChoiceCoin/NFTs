Background information
Before creating our own NFT, let’s take a look at the technologies and features that make NFTs work.

Fungible vs. non-fungible
Fungibility is essentially the ability to exchange an item for a similar item of the same value. Consider a five-dollar bill. It always equals the same amount anywhere in the world. You can exchange five one-dollar bills for a single five-dollar bill, and they are worth the same value all the time.

On the other hand, non-fungible items do not have the same value in comparison to each other. For example, an exact replica of the Mona Lisa is not equal in value to the original painting, despite being the same in every way. Non-fungible items are inherently unique and cannot be considered equivalent to any other item.

An item can be both fungible and non-fungible. For example, while two seats in economy class on a plane are worth the same price, one person may place sentimental value on a window seat, decreasing the value of every other seat for that person.

Blockchain
A blockchain is a public database or digital ledger that keeps track of transactions. It is replicated across several computer systems that are part of the chain. We’ll build our NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
